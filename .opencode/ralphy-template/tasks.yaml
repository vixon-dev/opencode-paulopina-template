# YAML Task Format for Ralphy
# Use this instead of PRD.md for more control over task execution
# Run with: ./.opencode/ralphy.sh --yaml tasks.yaml

tasks:
  # Basic tasks (run sequentially)
  - title: "Task 1 description"
    completed: false
  
  - title: "Task 2 description"
    completed: false

  # Parallel groups: tasks with same parallel_group run concurrently
  # Use --parallel flag to enable
  #
  # Example: Database models can be created in parallel
  # - title: "Create User model"
  #   completed: false
  #   parallel_group: 1
  #
  # - title: "Create Post model"
  #   completed: false
  #   parallel_group: 1
  #
  # - title: "Add relationships between models"
  #   completed: false
  #   parallel_group: 2  # Runs after group 1 completes
